        proceed to apply and strengthen understanding
      explain universe using forces and materials that need no previous education to see and naively understand with minimal guidance
        sound, touch, color, shape, texture, tension... etc

  'end game'
  	Space Baby
    Create a body, home, city, planet, universe we are happy to call home, then see what else is out there.


I try to organize my ideas like code.
  The whitespace means this is still in context of the statement above

This is an entirely separate point.

$WordsLikeThis means that I probably have it defined in one of these pages.
  words-$LikeThis means that we're talking about the 'words' that is of type '$LikeThis'

Pips added, for 'planks in progress' small digestible bites of info.
Story added, longer more than one plank for same idea.
Will become sub-planks and nested/linked information in the 3d 'space'.
Few more planks to help shed some light.
