In order for me to record the ideas I'm trying to share, I need to create some placeholders so I can assemble these ideas into the single larger idea.
  I am presenting some vocabulary that can act as a shortcut to these ideas when they come up again.
    I am not an authority on discrete or continuous multidimensional language nor am I pretending to be.
    I am just detailing the components to some of my larger ideas regarding objective reality.

  $Packet
    The other definition of quantum, as I don't want to mistake a $Packet for the $SpaceTimeArea of quantum mechanics
    A nondescript piece of $Information
    A granular component of $PhilosophicalMagnitudes, and $SpaceTimeAreas
    A single $Choice in $Individual
    A single $Actor in a $Community
    A plank length or fundamental particle in the $SpaceTimeAreas

  $Information
    Elements from the power set of $Packets.
    A collection of $packets that can be observed and measured in the $SpaceTimeAreas.
    A set of $Actors is $Information
    A bounded $SpaceTimeArea is $Information in the higher $SpaceTimeArea

  $Objective
    $Objective information is not an isolated fact in a $SpaceTimeArea
    $Objective means you are making an assumption about the $SpaceTimeArea using the information available
    An $Objective observation can end up being right or wrong
      $Objective is a moving target
      $Objective is statistics, not mandates
        Holding onto objective convictions in spite of overwhelming adversity is possibly brave, powerful and a heroic stand against entropy.
        Holding onto subjective convictions in spite of overwhelming evidence is not beneficial.

  $Objectivity
    $Objectivity aims to increase the organization of information
    $Objectivity learns from mistakes
    $Objectivity is learning

  $Subjective
    $information that is only retrievable from $Individual $SpaceTimeAreas
    $Subjective information that is confirmed in higher $SpaceTimeAreas can become $Objective

  $Discrete
    Each $Packet is distinct from one another
    There is a clear boundary between $Packets like pages in a book, seconds in a minute
    The $packets can be laid out and counted

  $Powerset($Information):
    A powerset is a function that takes in information and creates an new set.
    The new set is composed of all possible re-arrangements of the input set, in this case $Information

  $Continious
    In continuous space a $Packet is not under different rules/laws than its neighbors.
    In continuous space, $Packets may not be discernible from one another as the $Packet could be the fabric of the $SpaceTimeArea
    It means that a line would have no breaks or corners.

  $Heuristic
    A process that helps in making decisions.
    A $Heuristic may not be 100% correct all the time.
    A $Heuristic aims to get you in the right $SpaceTimeArea and further analysis can optimize.
    Local minima and local maxima are obstacles for $Heuristics

  $SpaceTimeAreas:
    The universe of observation, prediction, and quantifying success.
    The $SpaceTimeArea will contain everything needed to make objective $Decision.

  $Action
    Individual point in $SpaceTimeAreas
    Contained within $Decisions

  $Decide
    Boundaries to $Decisions in $SpaceTimeAreas
    Begins or ends a $Decision
    Different than $Decision

  $Decision
    Ranges within the $SpaceTimeAreas
    Premises for making $Actions
    Different than $Decide

  $Actor
    A single central point of decision making ability
    As a $Individual $Heuristic for visualizing the $PhilosophicalMagnitudes I imagine each actor as single input into a Reimann Zeta type family function.
      $Actions can be individual points in the critical strip.
      $Deciding changes the geometry of the critical strip.
      $Decisions can be illustrated as the critical strip.
      Further into the series the inputs are, the more abstract the goal/truth/.
    $Objective $Reality exists as the critical line in a Reimann Zeta function.
      If it is possible for $Actions taken in an $Objective reality to be $Objectively proven true.
        It would also be possible to $Decide to act $Objectively.
        Objective $Decisions may be provable for $Past, $Present, and $Future
          Prime numbers on the critical line act as my $Individual $Heuristic for visualizing objective demonstrable truths, laws, constants, etc.
    $Future might be solved if we can get quantum tunneling down.
      Our $Decisions in the $Future might be able to ignore some objective rules of the universe.

  $Stream
    Changes in $Packets or $Information are averaged out when looking at the whole of $SpaceTimeArea.
    Averaging a moving $Packet across a temporal dimension creates a body of $Information that resembles a snake from the old nokia phone game.
    All of the space occupied by the $Packet over the duration would be occupied by the $Packet when looking at the entire $SpaceTimeArea

  $SpaceTimeArea
    First imagine space, the three dimensional space your $Spacesuit is contained in.
    Your body, the room you are in, the building the room is in, the city, country, planet, and so on.
    Imagine that environment viewed over the course of time.
      Things that moved a lot within those boundaries would look like a $Stream

    Things that did not move or change within those boundaries would look perfectly clear.

    Scales and duration of influence for further illustrating the multi-dimensinal nature of our $Objective $SpaceTimeAreas.
      $Spacesuit (milimeters to meters, human lifetime, seconds to years)
        Last few minutes would create a $Stream across your living area
        Nokia snake.

      $Building (meters to kilometers, construction lifetime, years to decades)
        The lifetime of the building would appear as a pretty clear perforated structure with $Streams flowing in, out, and around the building landscape.
        Rock in shallow water stream/brook/river.

      $City (kilometers, generation scales, decades)
        Grows up out of land like a concrete moss, spreads and gets taller

      $Landscape (hundreds of kilometers, species scales, millenia)
        $Streams slither across a changing landscape, blemishes (cities) on the landscape appear and move or disappear

      $Planet (thousands of kilometers, geologic scales, eras, hundreds of millions of years)
        $Planet starts as cloud of fire, cools and grows connections with neighboring $Planets, eventually is consumed by neighboring star or darkness
      .
      bigger
      .
      longer
      .
      $Universe (universal scales, billions of light years, billions->10^lots of years)
        The $Universe was small and hot which expanded to billions of light years across and will continue to expand until cold and dark.

      $Navigation
        Going from one area in a $SpaceTimeArea to another
        Gradient descent algorithms - Back propagation

    Subjective reality:
      This is where ideas, creation, and $Decisions come from.
      $Individual (all possible universal scales, time periods, realities)
        Any reality you wish to create can be created within your $Individual reality.
        Can help hold onto ideas until you can objectively experiment with your ideas.
        Can create new geometries for new math.
        Can create new art for displaying new feelings.
        Can create new tools for reducing the amount of pain, suffering and toil.
