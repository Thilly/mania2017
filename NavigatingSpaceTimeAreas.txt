Visualizing the $Navigation of $SpaceTimeArea $Decisions is a tricky bit.

Deciding something is akin to a path finding problem of an $Actor through a $SpaceTimeArea
  I imagine visualizing individual tasks like a tiny bug inside of a fish inside of a fish tank trying to steer the fish.
  Entropy in this case can be seen as water constantly filling up the tank at an increasing rate.
    As more and more water comes in, more space, the tank heater, filter, and fish have to work harder for same results.
      If the walls of the tank are too weak, the tank-$SpaceTimeArea will lose to the 'big rip'
      If the walls of the tank are strong enough to allow the water to continually flow in until all the fish, plants, and heat get flushed out. The tank-$SpaceTimeArea will lose to a 'heat death'.
    Either way, entropy is the encroaching obliteration for our $Actors and $SpaceTimeAreas.

  The tiny bug-$Actor has to convince the fish-$Actor using $Objective means gathered from the fish-$SpaceTimeArea to achieve some goal in the tank-$SpaceTimeArea.
  Then the tiny bug-$Actor can further use the fish-$Actor to observe and quantify the tank-$SpaceTimeArea to make better $Decisions about where to steer the fish-$Actor in the $Future.

  bug-$Actor must obey the $Objective rules of the fish-$SpaceTimeArea and the fish-$Actor.
    Assuming subjective information about the fish-$SpaceTimeArea increases entropy.
      If the bug-$Actor is somehow convinced the fish-$SpaceTimeArea is different than it is.
       Inconsistencies will bring pain and suffering to the bug-$Actor since the effort in steering a jellyFish-$Actor will seem like un-productive toil.
    The bug-$Actor decided to move the fish-$Actor, it will continue expending effort to move the fish-$Actor until:
      bug-$Actor is lost to entropy
      fish-$Actor moves, bug succeeds and decides to do something else
      fish-$Actor is uncooperative and does not move, or does not move how expected.
        (Be Objective) The bug-$Actor can use the new observation to change the $Decision in bug-$Individual to closer match the fish-$SpaceTimeArea
        (Change Goals) The bug-$Actor can decide to no longer try to move the fish.

I think We can visualize this traversal of the bug-$Actor through the tank-$SpaceTimeArea as a path finding problem of an $Actor through a $SpaceTimeArea through a $SpaceTimeArea.
  bug-$Actor has identified important qualities of the tank-$SpaceTimeArea
  bug-$Actor can see the qualities in the tank are not evenly dispersed.
    Light towards up
    plants towards down
    food in small localized regions
  The tank-$SpaceTimeArea can be seen as a volume gradient of proximity to goals.
  When steering the fish-$SpaceTimeArea, bug-$Actor only needs to start in the directions the goal gradient is pointing you toward.
    The bug-$Actor can take samples from the tank-$SpaceTimeArea while steering the fish-$Actor to make sure the direction is always the direction bug-$Actor wants to go.
    If the decision making process becomes $Continious the bug-$Actor will always be heading for a goal in line with $Decisions in bug-$Individual.
  “When there is no desire,
  all things are at peace.”
  ― Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching

When the expenditure of energy, observations of pain and suffering are added to the goal gradient.
  It becomes very easy to make decisions over multiple scales that can benefit all parties involved.
  But A drop in entropy is not always evidence of a bad decision
    Find better state of organization AFTER increasing entropy shortly in all scales of decision making is better when absolutely necessary
      Health (individual) alcohol on a wound causes pain with aims to prevent infectious bacteria from making you sick
      Honesty (relationship) disagreements in personal identity leave an opportunity to strengthen a relationship
      Industry(society scales) failing industry leaves a void for an increase in education
      Biodiversity(planetary scales) dinosaurs left a void for us
