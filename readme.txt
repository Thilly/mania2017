I am bipolar and I created these 'works' during a manic episode.
Some people are manic poets, some are manic painters. I was a manic scribbler and programmer.
I was fighting with paradoxes and attempting to solve some really hard questions while I 'understood everything'.
I made some neat things while trying to solidify an atypical perspective.
I think its disingenuous to try to forget one of the 'loudest' experiences of my life.
Maybe I can avail what I went through and help illustrate the bipolar journey in a different medium.
