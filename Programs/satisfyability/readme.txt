These programs aim to take a series of seemingly unrelated statements and find a 'solution'.
How, where, when do they all line up.
Instead of looking at the statements as single points in time and trying to connect the dots through brute force.
Each statement is plotted through the entire context.
The statements are overlaid and then the family of functions is sliced up.
Each slice can be checked to see if a solution is contained therein.
The slices can be traversed and even further sliced up.

One dimensional statements are plotted through the entire context, creating a two dimensional curve.
The amount of statements plotted change nothing about the context, there is only the encompassing context.

When looking at decision making where a solution is unknown, the only thing certain is the current context.
However, estimations and predictions can be made about the near future.
These statistical likelihoods can determine steps to take now, to help direct an unsolved statement to a solution.
Steps can be taken, and reflected on to see if the solution is closer or further away.
