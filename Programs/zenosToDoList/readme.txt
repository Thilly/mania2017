Human beings are notoriously bad at multitasking and also bad at understanding steps to undertake monolithic tasks. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIBVPAS3H8127BjcrmQGW2JB1Cee1p5p
This todo list proposes an old way to look at task management.
Approach a gargantuan task like a supertask. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffUnNaQTfZE

Start with a seemingly monolithic task. Something that just cant be done in one sitting.

  Making it through school.
  Preparing for a marathon.
  Bringing a new idea to life.

From there start adding the steps necessary to make any progress, not complete.

  Complete an assigned project.
  Run for half an hour.
  Create an outline of the idea.

These component tasks can be further broken down further to seemingly trivial tasks.

  Turn on computer.
  Put on shoes.
  Grab a pen.

Even though these trivial tasks are just that, trivial. They inch you closer to a state where the monolithic task is completed.
The main task doesn't have to be finished now, or even tomorrow, but every seemingly insurmountable task is completed with a series of trivial efforts.

  The greatest programs were written with individual keystrokes.
  Every marathon was completed with individual strides.
  Timeless works of art are composed of individual strokes of a brush.
  Buildings are placed one brick at a time.

Progress is progress, inch forward on the task until it is so close to being done that the task itself is the trivial step.
