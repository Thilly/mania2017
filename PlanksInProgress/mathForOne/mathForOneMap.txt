Inconsistencies
  1: The graph y=x^2 and y=x intersect at a non-mathematically significant point.
    Not inflection point
    Non-zero tangent
    Change math 'universe' at 1

  2: The natural, integer, rational and irrational number systems can be used for large values (>2) and our day to day math.
    Abstract "Universe" (-infinity, infinity)
      points, values, steps, discrete
      subjectivity, language

  3: The Real numbers are not points, but areas, durations, pieces of something larger.
      Real "Universe" (0, 1)
      ranges, areas, probabilities, durations, lengths, continuous
      objectivity, relative observations and comparisons

labelingUniverse
  Pd: PastDuration
    The whole context, from the beginning up to the present.
  Fd: FutureDuration
    The potential states of the context.
  Nd: NaturalDuration
    The length of this entire context build from pieces.
    Pd (1/2) + Fd (1/2) = Whole context 2/2 (1)

  Pt: Present
    The current state, now.
  St: Start
    The event that began the context.
  Et: End
    The event that will end the context.
