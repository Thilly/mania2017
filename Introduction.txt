Multidimensional Approach to Objective Decision Making

  I opine that there is only one natural constant, time.
  I opine that all Reals are points, ranges, areas, volumes, ... nD shapes produced with respect to a duration in time.
  This larger structure is bounded and finite but infinitely divisible. (SuperTasks)

  The real number domain is between 0 and 1.

  Very interesting math happens with this new assumption.
    We can look at an entire universe with a single family of functions.
    Space and time become solvable and recursive.
    A universe can be encoded into a single function with respect to time.
    t < C can be identified as the $Past
    t = C can be identified as the $Present
    t > C can be identified as the $Future

  The universe is a bounded a hypervolume
  Reimann Zeta functions critical strip, line, points.

  We only took a peek at the walls of what we are all living in and as far as we can tell, it will end eventually.
    Entropy has been identified as inevitable obliteration unless our understanding of the universe can change.
    Our universe had a start, it will have an end.
  Humans can only solve entropy if humans decide to.

  It wasn't powersets of powersets, its zetas of zetas.
