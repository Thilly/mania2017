Multidimensional Approach to Objective Decision Making

  Cogito ergo sum.
  I think therefore I am.
  I am different than what is not me.
  I am conscious.
  Consciousness is something
  Something is not nothing
  Something is not zero
  One is not zero
  One is something that can make a decision. ex: (you, me, them, us, humans. Also, birds, fish, earthlings in general thus far)
  One is consciousness
    Transistors only hold our choices*(1)
  Speed of light is a constant (objective measurement)
  Universe is expanding (observation of the past)
  Global Positioning System (experiment in the present)
  General Relativity is correct.*(2) (prediction for the future)

  The speed of light is the natural phenomenon by which to measure the universe expanding which is explained by general relativity which becomes a much necessary component in the practical experiment of GPS, because we have been assuming, 1 != 0(2)
  We only took a peek at the walls of what we are all living in and as far as we can tell, it will end eventually.*(3)
    The universe currently has an objective opposition, entropy, disorder, obliteration, big rip or heat death.
    Entropy is the ragnarok, rapture, and end days our fathers before us have warned about.
    Entropy has been identified as inevitable obliteration unless our understanding of the universe can change.
  Humans can only solve entropy if humans decide to.

1: So far. Since they are built, placed, and 'decided for' by humans.

2: Correct in the current objective reality sense of, "well yea... GR works as a cog in our (exquisitely fancy) clocks".
  Its probably not the perfect or complete recipe for the universe.
  There's still much discussion around symmetry, quantum mechanics and strings which I don't really understand so no real opinion but, "Neat. I wanna hear more".

3: Really eventually. Nothing to wait around for, this is expected to be billions of billions of years in the future.
